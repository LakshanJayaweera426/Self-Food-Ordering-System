This Python code appears to be a command-line program for managing and ordering food items from a hypothetical restaurant called "Chamathka Food Center."

Functionality:
1. Welcome Message: The program starts with a welcome message, displaying the name of the restaurant.
2. Menu: It provides a menu to the user with several categories of food items, including Bakery items, Rice and Curries, Cake items, and Drinks. Users can select their preferred category or choose to exit the program.
3. Category-specific Functions: For each food category (Bakery, Rice and Curries, Cake, and Drinks), there are functions like bakeryItemTot(), riceItemTot(), cakeItemTot(), and drinkItemTot(). These functions allow users to select specific food items, enter the quantity they want, and calculate the total cost for those items within the chosen category.
4. Order Summary: The program keeps track of the selected food items, quantities, and prices within each category. Users can continue adding items within a category until they choose to exit that category. After selecting items from various categories, the program provides a summary of the selected items and their total cost.
5. Order Confirmation: Users can enter their name, and the program provides an order confirmation message along with the total cost of the order. It mentions that the order will be ready within 5 minutes.
6. Exiting the Program: Users can choose to exit the program at any time by selecting the "Exit" option from the menu.
